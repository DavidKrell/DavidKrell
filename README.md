<span style="font-size:2em;">I am currently studying computer science at the Philipps University of Marburg. My main interest lies in the development and research of DNA storage systems as a solution to the exponential growth of our data sphere[^1]. I am also interested in topics such as IT security, especially DNA cryptography[^2]. Other more theoretical aspects of computer science, such as the complexity theory and related optimisation problems over graphs such as the TSP, also interest me.</span>
